# ECU Network Setup Tool
This is a personal project to make the BYOD policy at East Carolina University much easier.

Some notes:

1. The code is written in the AutoIT language. To learn more about AutoIT, check out https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/.
2. I cannot distribute certain files. I'm only making the code available to people who want to look at it and get an understanding at what this does.
3. The code is very ugly and I definitely know that, but I'm not a pro and I'm revising the code whenever I can.
